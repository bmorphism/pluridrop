This is a hack for ETHPortland2022

TL;DR airdrop tooling for `cw20` tokens based on Twitter / Ethereum activity

# What

0. get a list of signatories of [Pluriverse artifact](https://pluriverse.world/)

1. eight `cw-20` contract instances on https://daodao.zone - one for each of the values of the Pluriverse

2. dApp connecting MetaMask (or Twitter) + Keplr with Junø wallet to claim airdrop

3. after connecting, the signatories can claim the Pluridrop in the amount of token per value for which they added signature and text.
